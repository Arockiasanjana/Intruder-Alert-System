# Intruder-Alert-System
This project implements a cost-effective intruder detection system using an Arduino Nano and IR sensor. The system detects unauthorized motion within a 2-30 cm range and triggers immediate audible alerts through a buzzer, providing a basic security solution for homes, offices, and restricted areas.
